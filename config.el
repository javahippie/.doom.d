;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom. Here
;; are the three important ones:
;;
;; + `doom-font'
;; + `doom-variable-pitch-font'
;; + `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.

;; They all accept either a font-spec, font string ("Input Mono-12"), or xlfd
;; font string. You generally only need these two:
 (setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
       doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 13))
